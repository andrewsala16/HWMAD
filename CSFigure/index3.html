        The Invention of Unix <break>
        While Ritchie was working at Bell Labs in the later 1960s, he and Ken Thompson incented Unix. The goal was to create a time-sharing computer system for the office. The first version of Unix was on a PDP-7 minicomputer. They worked on making it adaptable to other computers. Soon the patent department at Bell Labs began using the system for their daily work.

        The Invention of 'C' Language<break>
        A successor to the programming language B, C was made specifcally for running on Unix. C is made for machine instructions and is still being used for assembly language. It was designed to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory. main()
{
    printf("hello, world\n");
}
